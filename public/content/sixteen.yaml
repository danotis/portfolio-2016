    album-link: 'https://open.spotify.com/album/6bSJPJU1SRxm9RQ4Ox5sRe'
    copy: Releasing two records within 15 months is a challenge in itself. Releasing two <i>great</i> records within 15 months is on another level. Dawes experimented a bit with this one and it paid off.

    album-link: 'https://open.spotify.com/album/26DseQO366JfXwIP7dIgQj'
    copy: Took me awhile to notice this band/record, but once I did it really stuck with me. Can't wait to see what's next for Toledo and the rest.

    album-link: 'https://open.spotify.com/album/6vuykQgDLUCiZ7YggIpLM9'
    copy: <i>A Moon Shaped Pool</i> is by no means a disappointing record, but it wasn't what I anticipated so it took a little longer to strike a chord. However, it's still a Radiohead record so it's still incredible.

    album-link: 'https://open.spotify.com/album/0trXyj8mCIk1ssJWpQqezi'
    copy: Shawn Harris' best project since The Matches. Surfy. Grungy. Happy. Poignant. If you want to smile, put this record on and when it's over, listen to his <i>Take/Leave EP</i>.

    album-artwork: <img src="/img/albums/thrice.jpg">
    album-link: 'https://open.spotify.com/album/4hFDcpvIU9F4OleRAR9nNZ'
    copy: Politically speaking, this record was made for 2016. It seems the 6 year hiatus proved a smart decision for Thrice as they came back with a vengance and released their best record since 2005.

    album-artwork: <img src="/img/albums/bon.jpg">
    album-link: 'https://open.spotify.com/album/1PgfRdl3lPyACfUGH4pquG'
    copy: Weird, exciting, soothing, and heartfelt. Justin Vernon's juxtaposition of electronic&mdash;and at times mechanical&mdash;sounds with his signature falsetto gives me chills with every listen.

    album-link: 'https://open.spotify.com/album/4TiJdmV0Oh7GauOdmfrXNe'
    copy: I can't say enough great things about Charles Bradley. Seeing him live was one of the highlights of my entire year. The man oozes a passion for his craft and love for people. About a month after the show he announced he was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Sending all the love back to him.

    album-link: 'https://open.spotify.com/album/45v99hK5qTdmvbC615X6V5'
    copy: Joey Vannucchi has never written a bad record. <i>Everything Feels Better Now</i> is a slight change in course for From Indian Lakes, but it is a welcome and fantastic one. Constantly find myself getting lost in every moment of this album.

    album-link: 'https://open.spotify.com/album/03hVtUfmQW3fhMbYoliIod'
    copy: I've been waiting for Jimmy Eat World to take back the top spot on this list since I started making them. <i>Integrity Blues</i> doesn't return to the JEW sound of old as a fan service, it expands on all the things we love about them exquisitely.
